# Project Title

WhatsApp Chat Sentiment Analysis

# Description

Exported the chat from WhatsApp and extracted the files in the form of "text file",then imported the dataset after importing found the time,author and messages of WhatsApp.
In the next step preprocessed the dataset and after cleaning the dataset it will be trained for our project.
I have used Sentiment Intensity Analyzer Algorithm to train the project.


# Sentiment Intensity Analyzer Algorithm is a NLTK's VADER module it gives the output either positive or negative.
# Also,It uses polarity score method to finding the Sentiments of our chat.
